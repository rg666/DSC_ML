This is a basic level ML project. The objective is build a ML model to identify the type of Iris flowers based on it's physical attributes.

The best small project to start with in ML is the classiﬁcation of iris ﬂowers. This is a good dataset to begin with because it is very well understood.

Attributes are numeric so handling of data is not needed

It is a classiﬁcation problem, an easier type of supervised learning problem

It is small and easily fits memory. It only has 4 attrfeatures and 150 rows

All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale. So feature scaling and transformations are not needed

Typical Steps in an ML project

Loading dataset
Summarizing dataset
Visualizing dataset
Evaluating algorithms
Making some predictions

Please refer to the jupyter notebook for step-by-step execution.
